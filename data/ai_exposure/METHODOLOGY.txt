AI Occupational Exposure Index
==============================

Based on Felten, Raj, and Seamans (2021) methodology.

Data Sources (all free):
1. O*NET Database: https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html
   - Download: "Abilities" and "Work Activities" files

2. BLS OES Data: https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm
   - Industry-occupation employment matrices

3. AI Application Mapping:
   The Felten et al. approach maps AI capabilities to O*NET abilities.
   Their scores are available at: https://osf.io/3a5n2/

Construction Steps:
1. Map AI applications to cognitive abilities in O*NET
2. Calculate ability-level AI exposure scores
3. Aggregate to occupation level using ability importance weights
4. Aggregate to industry level using employment shares
